    This game is not out yet but I put the dungeons code here for my portfolio.

    A pico8 game with currently 1 month and a half of work.

    For this game I realised : 
    - A game with a low level architecture in pico8
    - A player that can move in a grid with fluid animations and cast spells in complex menus
    - Rogue/PokemonMysterDungeon like dungeons with traps, enemies, breakable pots
    - Multiple enemy types with different AIs and pathfinding using Dijsktra algorithm

    THIS CODE WAS INSPIRED BY BOTH :
    - https://www.youtube.com/@LazyDevs
    - http://rogueliketutorials.com

    Credit belongs to them for the inspiration, I analysed both of their code
    to then write my own for what I wanted for my game in terms of dungeons.
